# Getting Started with Payments

Welcome to the Setu Payments documentation. This guide will help you integrate payment solutions into your application.

## Overview

Setu provides a comprehensive suite of payment APIs that enable you to:

- Accept payments via UPI, cards, and net banking
- Process refunds and settlements
- Handle webhooks and notifications
- Manage payment flows

## Quick Start

### 1. Get API Keys

First, you'll need to obtain your API keys from the Setu dashboard:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.setu.co/auth/keys" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Make Your First Payment

Here's a simple example to create a payment link:

```javascript
const payment = await setu.payments.create({
  amount: 10000, // Amount in paisa (â‚¹100.00)
  currency: "INR",
  customer: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    phone: "+919876543210"
  },
  purpose: "Test Payment"
});

console.log(payment.paymentLink);
```

### 3. Handle Webhooks

Set up webhook endpoints to receive payment status updates:

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { status, paymentId, amount } = req.body;
  
  if (status === 'SUCCESS') {
    // Payment successful - update your database
    console.log(`Payment ${paymentId} successful for amount ${amount}`);
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```
